# Sink-Or-Swim-Battleship
A simple variation of Battleship Solitaire and Multiplayer Battleship using React Native and React Hooks. Currently under development.

To run application, run `npm install` to have the required dependencies and then `npm start` or `expo start`. The app is currently being developed using an Android Emulator (Pixel 3a) and may vary for devices.
Alternatively, you can also simply install the Expo app on an Android device and scan the QR code after running `expo start` or `npm start`.

There will be continuous updates throughout the coming weeks. At the moment, the final game conditions and board set up are in development (lose condition and board x and y axes).
